To run it, copy it to /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, then just run "fuzzyinstall" without the quotes. To pick package manager, just type in the package manager after fuzzyinstall.
Options for package manager are: apt, dnf, xbps, pacman. Don't use capitals, and not apt-get, pacman -S, xbps-install, or dnf install, just apt, dnf, xbps, or pacman.
